# citedy-content-ingestion

> Turn any URL into structured content — YouTube videos, web articles, PDFs, and audio files — ready for any LLM pipeline.

## What It Does

Submit a URL and get back clean structured content: full transcript, summary, metadata, and word count. YouTube ingestion uses the Gemini Video API for deep video understanding beyond auto-generated captions — capturing speaker intent, visual context, and chapter structure. Use as a standalone input node for summarization, Q&A, article generation, or knowledge base indexing. Batch up to 20 URLs in one call.
