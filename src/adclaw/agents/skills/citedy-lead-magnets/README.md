# citedy-lead-magnets

> Generate AI-powered checklists, swipe files, and frameworks that convert visitors into subscribers — as a downloadable PDF with optional AI illustrations.

## What It Does

Produces ready-to-publish PDF lead magnets in minutes. Choose from three types: checklists (step-by-step action items), swipe files (curated templates and scripts), or frameworks (structured methodologies). Each lead magnet gets a hosted lead capture page where visitors enter their email to download the PDF. No other MCP or skill store offers lead magnet generation — this is a unique capability powered exclusively by Citedy.
