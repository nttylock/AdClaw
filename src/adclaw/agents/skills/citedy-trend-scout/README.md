# citedy-trend-scout

> Scout X/Twitter and Reddit for what your audience is talking about right now, deep-analyze competitors, and find content gaps — all in one workflow.

## What It Does

Combines real-time social signals from X/Twitter and Reddit with SEO intelligence. Unlike tools that show historical search volume, this skill shows what people are discussing today and maps those signals directly to content opportunities your competitors haven't covered yet. Run a morning briefing, discover competitors by keyword, deep-analyze their content strategy, and generate content gap reports against their blogs.
