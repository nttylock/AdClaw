# citedy-content-writer

> End-to-end blog autopilot — from topic to published, multi-platform content campaign in one conversation, in 55 languages.

## What It Does

Covers the entire content production pipeline: research from URLs or topics, generate SEO- and GEO-optimized articles (4 size presets, 55 languages, 25 writing personas), enhance with AI illustrations and voice-over, adapt for 9 social platforms (X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Reddit, Threads, Instagram, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Shopify), and set up cron-based autopilot sessions for hands-free publishing. Includes a product knowledge base so the AI references your real product data during generation.
